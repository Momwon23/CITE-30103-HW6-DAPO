The issue is a precedence issue: the + has a higher precedence than the << so its read as (a+b) << 1 which then becomes 16. 

The fix to this is to have it as res = a+ (b<<1); where b would be shifted first and turn into 6 and then it will add 5 where you have a totoal of 11. 

corrections: int a=5 , b=3, res;
            res = a + (b<<1);
