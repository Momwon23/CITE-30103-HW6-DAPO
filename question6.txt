Question 6 [4 points]
Find and correct all identifier naming errors below. Explain which rules are violated.
int 1value = 10;
float avg-rate = 12.5;
char Class = 'A';


Answer: 
- int 1value: breaks the first rule, which is it must begin with a letter or underscore symbol, int 1value starts with 1 so it fails the naming rules.
- avg-rate: is not a valid name for an identifier because (-) breaks the rules for c , which states the names must consist of letters, digits, or underscores only, a dash breaks that rule.
- Class: breaks the rules of using a C reserved word.
